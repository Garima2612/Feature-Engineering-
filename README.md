# Feature-Engineering-

Overview
This project involves comprehensive feature engineering techniques applied to a housing dataset to prepare it for machine learning models. The dataset comprises 1,460 rows and 81 columns, including various features such as MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, and SalePrice.

Key Steps and Techniques:

1.Data Understanding and Cleaning:
 Loaded the dataset using Pandas and conducted an initial inspection to understand its structure and dimensions (df.shape and 
 df.columns).
 Identified variables with null values and calculated the number of missing values for each column to determine data cleaning 
 needs.
 Handled missing values using various strategies, such as imputation for numerical features and mode replacement for categorical 
 features.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Performed EDA to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers.
 Used visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn) to analyze the distribution of features and relationships between them.

3.Feature Engineering:
 Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
 Transformed existing features to better represent the underlying data (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical 
 features).
 Addressed skewness in numerical features by applying appropriate transformations (e.g., logarithmic scaling).

4.Handling Categorical Variables:
 Converted categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding to ensure compatibility with machine 
 learning algorithms.

5.Interaction Features:
 Generated interaction features to capture the relationships between different variables, improving the model's ability to learn 
 complex patterns.

6.Feature Selection:
 Conducted feature selection to identify and retain the most important features for the predictive model.
 Utilized methods like correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination to streamline the feature set.


Tools and Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.


Outcome:
The feature engineering process significantly improved the dataset's quality, enhancing the performance of downstream machine learning models. The project showcases a thorough approach to preparing data for predictive modeling, demonstrating expertise in data cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
